# 2-Norm of a matrix
## Aim
To write a program to find the 2-norm of the matrix and display the result in two decimal places.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1. Get the input matrix using np.array()
2. The 2-Norm of a matrix is given by ![input.jpg](normeqn1.jpg) 
3. Find the 2-norm of the matrix using np.linalg.norm()
4. Print the norm of the matrix in two decimal places.
## Program:
~~~
